## Describe Request and Response Format

Every API request is made through HTTP using standard methods like `GET` and `POST`.  
Responses are returned in **JSON** format.

Authentication Requirements
To make API calls, you must authenticate using an API key or Bearer access token.

Steps:
Create an account on The Movie Database.

Generate an API key from your account settings.

Include the key or token in every request:

As a query parameter: ?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY

Or as an Authorization header:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

Some endpoints that require user-specific data (such as rating a movie or managing lists) will need a user-level access token.

## Error Handling
Common errors and how to handle them:

Error Type	Status Code	Example Message	Explanation
Invalid API Key	401	"Invalid API key: You must be granted a valid key."	The provided key is missing or incorrect.
Resource Not Found	404	"The resource you requested could not be found."	The requested endpoint or ID doesn’t exist.
Bad Request	400	"Value too high: Value must be ≤ 10.0."	Invalid request parameters or JSON data.
Too Many Requests	429	"Rate limit exceeded. Try again later."	You exceeded the API request limit.
Server Error	500 / 503	"Internal server error."	The issue is on the API’s side — try again later.

## Handling Tips
Always check the HTTP status code before processing the response.

Parse the JSON body for status_code and status_message to understand the issue.

Implement retries with backoff for 429 or 5xx errors.

Show user-friendly messages instead of raw error text.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices
## Usage Limits
The API enforces rate limits (requests per second or per day).

If you exceed the limit, the API returns a 429 Too Many Requests response.

## Best Practices
Cache frequently requested data such as genres, configuration, and movie details.

Use pagination (page parameter) for large datasets.

Fetch /configuration once and reuse the image base URLs.

Secure your API key — never expose it in client-side or public code.

Handle rate limits gracefully by retrying after the delay specified in the headers.

Only request the data you actually need to reduce bandwidth.

Always comply with the API’s terms and provide attribution when required.
